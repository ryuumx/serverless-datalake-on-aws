# Part 1: Ingest and Store

## 1. Create an S3 Bucket

In this step, we will navigate to S3 Console and create the S3 bucket used throughout this demo.

First, navigate to S3 Console & create a new bucket in us-east-1 region :

* Open the [S3 console]( https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/home?region=us-east-1)
* Click on **:heavy_plus_sign: Create bucket**
    * Bucket Name: **YOUR_USERNAME-datalake-demo-bucket**
    * Region: **US EAST (N. Virginia)**
    * and proceed to create the bucket: **Create** (bottom left)

We now have an S3 bucket named `YOUR_USERNAME-datalake-demo-bucket`. 

You have now set up an S3 bucket! What can you put into an S3 bucket?

In it, we will create a subfolder for storing data. 
We will use this folder structure for this lab series.

```
*--YOUR_USERNAME-datalake-demo-bucket
         │
         ├── data/
         │     └── (raw)
         │     └── (reference)
         │     └── (training)
         │
         └── (..other project assets: code etc.)
         
```

To create a subfolder, 

* Click on the bucket name: **YOUR_USERNAME-datalake-demo-bucket**
* You are now looking at the contents of your bucket. It is currently empty.
* Click on **:heavy_plus_sign: Create folder**
* Enter the value `data` into the text field. 
   * You can choose *AES-256* SSE with Amazon S3-Managed Keys for this step
   * Click on **Save**
   
You now have the above bucket structure.

## 2. Create a Kinesis Firehose delivery stream

In this step we will start streaming data into the S3, using *Kinesis Firehose (FH)*.

** First, create a FH Delivery Stream. **

* Open the Kinesis Console: https://console.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/home?region=us-east-1#/get-started

* Amazon Kinesis consists of several services: Kinesis Data Streams, Kinesis Firehose, Kinesis Data Analytics and Kinesis Video Streams.
![Kinesis FH](./img/kfh_console.png)


* To create a FH delivery stream, Click on **Create delivery stream**
    * Step 1: Name and source
        * Delivery stream name: **aws-labseries-demo-stream**
        * Source: **Direct PUT or other sources**
        * Click **Next**
        
    * Step 2: Process records
        * Record transformation: Disabled
        * Record format conversion: Disabled
        * Click **Next**
        
    * Step 3: Choose destination
        * Destination: **Amazon S3**
        * S3 bucket: **YOUR_USERNAME-datalake-demo-bucket**. You can select it from the dropdown. 
        * Backup S3 bucket prefix: `data/raw/`  
            * the backslash `/` after `raw/` is *important*. Without it, your data will land in a outside of the intended folder.
        * Backup S3 bucket error prefix: `error/`
        * Click **Next**
        
    * Step 4: Configure settings
        * S3 buffer conditions: Buffer size: **1** (MB)
        * S3 buffer conditions:  Buffer interval: **60** (sec)
        * S3 compression : **Disabled**
        * S3 encryption : **Enabled**
        * KMS master key: (Default)aws/s3
        * Error logging : **Enabled**
        * Permissions: Confirm **Create or update IAM role KinesisFirehoseServiceRole-aws-labseries-us-east-1-xxx** is chosen
        * Click on **Next**
        
    * Step 5: Review
        * Review the configuration as you have set it up. 
        * To proceed with creating, click on **Create delivery stream**

You have now created a Firehose delivery stream that writes to an S3 bucket *YOUR_USERNAME-datalake-demo-bucket*
Now, it is time to start streaming data into your s3 bucket.


## 3. Generate Dummy Data

In this step we will configure an application, Kinesis Data Generator to generate random data/event streams into our data lake.

* **Configure Amazon Cognito** for Kinesis Data Generator - In this step we will launch a cloud formation stack that will configure Cognito.
    * Go to:  https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks/new?stackName=Kinesis-Data-Generator-Cognito-User&templateURL=https://aws-kdg-tools-us-east-1.s3.amazonaws.com/cognito-setup.json
    * Click - **Next**
    * **Specify stack details**. In this step you will create a mock admin for your data generator. Use a simple admin/password combination and keep it handy.
        * Stack name: (autofilled) **Kinesis-Data-Generator-Cognito-User**
        * Username: **admin**
        * Password: **choose a alphanumeric password**
        * Click on **Next**
    * **Configure stack option**
        * Leave all as-is.
        * Click on **Next**
    * Review your configurations, especially for Username and Password.
        * Scroll down
        * :ballot_box_with_check: Check on  **I acknowledge that AWS CloudFormation might create IAM resources**
        * Click on **Create stack**

CloudFormation is now creating a Cognito User you will use with the Data Generator.

You can view the created resources in the **Resources** tab.

When the Stack info status changes to to **Create_Complete**:

![CFN Complete](./img/cfn_kdg_complete.png)


Go to the **Outputs** tab. The Data Generator is deployed on the **KinesisDataGeneratorUrl**.

> [Kinesis Data Generator webpage sample](https://awslabs.github.io/amazon-kinesis-data-generator/web/producer.html?upid=us-east-1_GHRgoM2rL&ipid=us-east-1:7664a686-8373-4762-a867-eb0aa0fb0e89&cid=5efmfcsrq4ooabk4nbvhmqn2jp&r=us-east-1)

Click on your link to open the Data Generator.

* On Amazon Kinesis Data Generator homepage, **Login** with your username & password.

![KDG Console](./img/kdg_console.png)

You can now start generating data/event streams for your Firehose delivery.

    * Region: `us-east-1`
    * Stream/delivery stream : `aws-labseries-demo-stream`
    * Records per second : `2000`
    * Record template: Use the json template below: 

```
{
  "uuid": "{{random.uuid}}",
  "device_ts": "{{date.utc("YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss.SSS")}}",
  "device_id": {{random.number(50)}},
  "device_temp": {{random.weightedArrayElement(
    {"weights":[0.30, 0.30, 0.20, 0.20],"data":[32, 34, 28, 40]}
  )}},
  "track_id": {{random.number(30)}},  
  "activity_type": {{random.weightedArrayElement(
        {
            "weights": [0.1, 0.2, 0.2, 0.3, 0.2],
            "data": ["\"Running\"", "\"Working\"", "\"Walking\"", "\"Traveling\"", "\"Sitting\""]
        }
    )}}
}

```

What does this data/message look like? 
What type of application could this send a data stream similar to  this?

You're done! Click on **Send Data** to start sending data streams for Firehose!

Once the tools send ~ 100,000 messages, you can **Stop sending data to Kinesis**.



## 4. Validate that data has arrived in S3

Let's see if Firehose has successfully delivered data to your S3 bucket **YOUR_USERNAME-datalake-demo-bucket**. 

1. Open the S3 Console again: https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/home?region=us-east-1
   * Note that your region should be back to `us-east-1`
* Open your bucket **YOUR_USERNAME-datalake-demo-bucket** and the **data** folder.
* You will find a subfolder called **raw**. Click through the date-partitioned folders (2021 > xx > xx > xx) until you find a list of files named *aws-labseries-demo-stream-xx-xx-xx*.

![Firehose output](./img/firehose-output.png)


2. Open and view the contents of the data files. 

   ```
   {  "uuid": "a040cdd7-cc47-435f-9e5e-938da65e59a3",  "device_ts": "2019-09-26 15:49:32.004",  "device_id": 19,  "device_temp": 34,  "track_id": 22,    "activity_type": "Sitting"}
   {  "uuid": "e5d411f7-daf2-4801-8153-ce9ea560d66d",  "device_ts": "2019-09-26 15:49:32.006",  "device_id": 10,  "device_temp": 32,  "track_id": 1,    "activity_type": "Walking"}
   ...
   ```
   
## Extra Credit!

Let's try building a dashboard to visualize our log data. How can we find all unique activities with `"device_id":  10`?

1. Sign up for Quicksight. Subscribe to the Enterprise plan. 
      ![Signup](./img/qs00-signup.png)
.
2. Enable auto-discover for S3 and select the datalake-demo-bucket you have created
      ![Add permissions](./img/qs01-add-s3-permissions.png)
      
      ![Select bucket](./img/qs01-select-s3-bucket.png)

2. Add a data set. Go to Manage Data > New data set > S3
      1. Add a Data Source Name: My Firehose Log Data
      2. Upload a manifest file. You can use the provided [qs-manifest.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ryuumx/serverless-datalake-on-aws/master/lab1/qs-manifest.json). Download and edit the manifest file with the correct S3 bucket name.
      
      ![Edit manifest](./img/qs02-edit-manifest.png)
      
3. Upload the file to Quicksight and Connect
      
4. Once completed, click Visualize. 

5. Select a Vertical Bar Chart from bottom-left panel. Select activity_type as X axis from top-left panel. Wait for the data to get imported.

    What does this graph tell you?

      ![Chart unfiltered](./img/qs03-unfiltered.png)

6. From the left navigation, select on Filter. Add a filter using the + button.
      1. Select device_id > Filter List > Value `10`
      2. Click Apply
   
      ![Add filter](./img/qs03-add-filter.png)
      
6. You now have a vertical bar chart which shows the activity distribution for all events that belong to `"device_id" = 10`!

## More Credits

1. Create your own custom data template to generate data streams similar to your current project applications. KDG extends from [Faker.js](https://github.com/marak/Faker.js/). You can use this to generate stub names, timestamps, addresses etc.

2. How can you send data from a simple web application such as a Wordpress website? Hint: Kinesis has [Client Libraries](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/streams/latest/dev/developing-consumers-with-kcl.html) in Java, Node, .NET, Python and Ruby or a Kinesis Agent package
